The Signee receives requests from the network, generates a QR-Code and displays it on the screen. Then it scans the screen of the Signer to receive the answer, decodes the answer and sends it back to the network.

The following shows a high-level overview on how the Signee works. It also shows the interaction between the backend and the frontend.
