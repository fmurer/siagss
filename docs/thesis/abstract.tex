Keeping the signing key save and secure is a crucial part in the public key infrastructure (PKI). If an attacker manages to steal a signing key, he is able to sign requests by himself and making everyone believe that this request has been certified by the original key holder. The goal of this thesis is to develop a new approach how to store a signing key in an isolated environment, still being able to accept and sign requests. We achieve this by using an air-gapped channel and two subsystems, where one of them is completely isolated from any network, has reduced to no radio frequency emissions and in the optimal case not even attached directly to a power supply. The whole system should be able to handle a fair amount of requests a day while still be of relative low cost. Furthermore, we want to formally verify ceremonies when initialising, changing or backing up secret keys.
